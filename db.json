      "description": "Blood, Sweat & Tears, known for hits such as \"Spinning Wheel\", \"You've Made Me So Very Happy\", and \"And When I Die\", headlined the legendary Woodstock Festival and won multiple Grammy Awards, most notably 1970's win for Album Of The Year, besting The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" and \"Johnny Cash at San Quinten.\" This is the incredible never-before-told story about a top rock band that was unknowingly embroiled in a political rat’s nest involving the U.S. State Department, the Nixon White House and a controversial concert tour of Yugoslavia, Romania and Poland, countries that were behind what was then known as the Iron Curtain. As a result, they found themselves in the crossfire of a polarized America, as divided then as it is now."
